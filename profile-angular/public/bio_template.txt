    My name's <b>Astral!Void</b>, but you can also call me <b>Void</b>.<br>
    I'm a <b>programmer</b> and a <b>self-taught artist</b>, curious about the world. <br><br>
    
    Since I was a kid, I really loved the idea of <b>making my own video-games</b>.
    One of my oldest memories was sitting at my parents' old PC, either dabbling with GameMaker or modding Pok√©mon Emerald
    without knowing what I was doing.<br>
    But then, as I turned 15, I finally took my first steps in <b>programming</b>. I created my first games using <b>Scratch</b> and <b>Stencyl</b>, 
    my first websites using <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>, and learned about how computer parts work.<br>
    Eventually, as I went through high school -- and now, university -- I learned so many new things about computer science while
    also refining my old skills, but the desire to make something creative has always remained deep inside my heart.<br><br>

    At the same time, I remember drawing as far back as <b>2016</b>, but I only took it more seriously when <b>2020</b> got around.<br>
    During my lifetime, I've drawn so many OCs that I cannot count them with both hands haha.<br><br>

    Outside of that, I love <b>storytelling</b>, <b>voice acting</b> and <b>character creation</b>.<br>
    I've recently started playing <b>D&D</b> both as a player and as a Dungeon Master.<br><br>

    I hope you enjoy this trip inside my webspace :)
